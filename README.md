# Arm Cortex-M3 Hardware & Software Design

## Project description
- FPGA-based Arm Cortex-M3 hardware system build and software development
- Creating a Custom IP core and Integrating it into the System
  - Creating an AXI4 IP core in Vivado
  - Creating a Driver code with Xilinx Hardware Abstraction Layer API

## Getting Started
### Prerequisite
* Arm Cortex-M3 FPGA DesignStart Xilinx Edition
  
  ⚠️ You need to find the Cortex-M3 DesignStart FPGA Xilinx Edition (AT426) in the Arm Download Hub and download the compressed file.
  It may change over time, but I'll post the link information.
